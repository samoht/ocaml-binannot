Tests cases are organised as follows:
- the files prefix.ml and path.ml, expansion.ml and match_cases.ml are lists
  of tests cases: each line of these files which contains a $ is appended to
  prefix.ml to form a test case, with the -pos argument being the position of $
  (and â‚¬, if relevant).
- errors.ml and errors.ml.last_compiled form a single test (for backtracking)
- the rename*.ml (without _rres) files are standalone test cases
